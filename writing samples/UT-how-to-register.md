# How to Register Students Using UT mainframe
> This guide is intended for Graduate Coordinators, Student Advisors, and other academic administrators at UT Austin.

Student registration is handled using UT Austin's Administrative Computer System, or *mainframe*. This guide will walk you step by step through the student registration process, allowing you to manage student class schedules, add and drop classes, and change class grading bases. 

## Access UT mainframe - Student Portal
1. Navigate to the [UT mainframe online](https://virtel.its.utexas.edu/w2h/appmenu.htm+applist).

2. Click on the option `Students COM-PLETE`, which will load the Student Portal within the UT mainframe.

## Add a Class 
6. You now have access to a student's registration record, where you can register and adjust the student's schedule. To register a student for a class, type `2` in the ACTION CODE field.

7. Tab over or click on the UNIQUE field, then type the `5-digit unique number` (e.g.: 50599) for the course you want to add to a student's schedule. Course unique numbers can be found in the [Course Schedule](https://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules).

8. Once you've typed in the action code and unique number, hit Enter on your keyboard. If added successfully, the course will appear below, and the student's class and hours should update.

9. To drop a class from a student's schedule, type `3` in the ACTION CODE field.

10. Tab over or click on the UNIQUE field, then type the `5-digit unique number` for the course you want to drop from a student's schedule.

11. Hit Enter on your keyboard. The dropped course should disappear from the student's class schedule, and the student's classes and hours should update accordingly.

## Change a Class Grading Basis
The default grading basis for most classes at UT Austin is letter-grade. However, in some cases, a student may want to take a class as Credit/No Credit, meaning that the class will not be factored into the student's GPA calculation.
