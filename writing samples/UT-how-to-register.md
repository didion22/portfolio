# How to Use the Online Registration System
> This guide is intended for Graduate Coordinators, Student Advisors, and other academic administrators at UT Austin.

Graduate student registration is handled using the Online Registration System in the UT mainframe. Whether you want to add or drop a class from a student's schedule, or change a class grading basis, this guide will walk you through accessing and using the Online Registration System.

## Access the Student Portal in the UT mainframe

* Sign in with your UT EID and password.

* Choose the option `Students COM-PLETE`, which will open the Student Portal.

## Add a Class 
* To add a class to a student's schedule, type `2` in the **ACTION CODE** field.

* In the **UNIQUE** field, type the `5-digit unique number` (for example, `50599`) of the class you want to add to a student's schedule. Class unique numbers can be found in the [Course Schedule](https://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules).

* Select the Enter key. If added successfully, the new class will appear in the student's class list below.

## Drop a Class
* To drop a class from a student's schedule, type `3` in the **ACTION CODE** field.

* In the **UNIQUE** field, type the `5-digit unique number` of the class you want to drop from a student's schedule.

* Select the Enter key. If dropped successfully, the dropped class will disappear from the student's class list below.

## Change a Class Grading Basis

> [!WARNING]
>
> [Graduate School Policy](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/navigating/policies/academic/grades) limits the classwork a student can take as Credit/No Credit.
> * **Master's students**: No more than 20% of classwork can be taken as Credit/No Credit.
> * **Doctoral students**: No more than "a comparable portion of the doctoral Program of Work" as Credit/No Credit. Check with the student's Graduate Advisor to determine a "comparable portion".
>   
> If you are unsure about the percentage of classwork a student has taken as Credit/No Credit, you can view their full academic record in [EASI](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/easi/index.WBX).

* To change the grading basis of a class, type `4` in the **ACTION CODE** field.

* In the **UNIQUE** field, type the `5-digit unique number` for the class you are attempting to change.

* Select the Enter key. The class should now display a _Z_ next to it, indicating that it is being taken for Credit/No Credit. The system will also display a text prompt confirming that the class has been changed to Credit/No Credit.

## Common Pitfalls
_Blocked from registering a student for a class outside your department?_
* The Online Registration System prevents administrators from registering students for classes outside their department major codes. To register a student for a class outside your department, contact the Graduate Coordinator for the department offering the class. A full list of department contacts can be found on the Graduate School's [Degrees & Programs webpage](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/degrees-programs).

_Unable to register a student after the 12th class day?_
* Registration after the 12th class day is considered Late Registration and cannot be completed using the mainframe's Online Registration System. Instead, fill out the Graduate School's [Request for Late Registration Form](https://utexas.box.com/s/t7x1iu0dgr9xjy3qud65rtscxjdv3d6h) and obtain a petition from the student's Graduate Advisor explaining the reason for the late registration. Submit both the form and petition to [GradStudentSvcs@austin.utexas.edu](mailto:gradstudentsvcs@austin.utexas.edu).

_Unable to drop or change the grading basis of a class after the 12th class day?_
* Drops and grading basis changes after the 12th class day cannot be completed using the mainframe's Online Registration System. Instead, fill out the [Graduate Add/Drop Form](https://lbj.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/add_drop_form_fillable_2020_1.pdf), which must be signed by the student, class instructor(s), and student's Graduate Advisor. Submit the form to [GradStudentSvcs@austin.utexas.edu](mailto:gradstudentsvcs@austin.utexas.edu).
