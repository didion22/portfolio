# How to Register Students Using UT mainframe
> This guide is intended for Graduate Coordinators, Student Advisors, and other academic administrators at UT Austin.

Student registration is handled using UT Austin's Administrative Computer System, or *mainframe*. This guide will walk you step by step through the student registration process, allowing you to manage student class schedules, add and drop classes, and change class grading bases. 

## Access UT mainframe - Student Portal
1. Navigate to the [UT mainframe online](https://virtel.its.utexas.edu/w2h/appmenu.htm+applist).
   
2. Sign in with your UT EID and password.

3. Click the option `Students COM-PLETE`, which will load the Student Portal in the UT mainframe.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Online Registration System is only accessible during registration windows. To see when registration windows occur, check the [Registration Information Sheet](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/registrar/ris.WBX) for the student you are attempting to register. 

5. When loaded successfully, the Online Registration System will appear and display the current registration semester. Type the EID of the student you are attempting to register, then hit Enter on your keyboard.

## Add a Class 
6. You now have access to an individual student's registration record. To register the student for a class, type `2` in the ACTION CODE field.

7. In the UNIQUE field, type the `5-digit unique number` (e.g.: 50599) for the course you want to add to the student's schedule. Course unique numbers can be found in the [Course Schedule](https://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules).

8. Hit Enter on your keyboard. If added successfully, the course number will appear below, and the student's classes and hours should update.

## Drop a Class
9. To drop a class from a student's schedule, type `3` in the ACTION CODE field.

10. In the UNIQUE field, type the `5-digit unique number` for the course you want to drop from a student's schedule.

11. Hit Enter on your keyboard. The dropped course should disappear from the student's class schedule, and the student's classes and hours should update accordingly.

## Change a Class Grading Basis

> [!WARNING]
>
> [Graduate School Policy](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/navigating/policies/academic/grades) limits the coursework a student can take as Credit/No Credit.
> * **Master's students**: No more than 20% of coursework can be taken as Credit/No Credit.
> * **Doctoral students**: No more than "a comparable portion of the doctoral Program of Work" as Credit/No Credit. Check with the student's Graduate Advisor to determine a "comparable portion".
>   
> If you are unsure about the percentage of coursework a student has taken as Credit/No Credit, you can view their full academic record in [EASI](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/easi/index.WBX).

12. To change the grading basis of a class, type `4` in the ACTION CODE field.

13. In the UNIQUE field, type the `5-digit unique number` for the course you are attempting to change.

14. Hit Enter on your keyboard. The course should now display a _Z_ next to it, indicating that it is being taken for Credit/No Credit. The system will also display a text prompt confirming that the course has been changed to Credit/No Credit.

## Common Pitfalls
_Blocked from registering a student for a course outside your department?_
* The Online Registration System prevents administrators from registering students for courses outside their department major codes. To register a student for a course outside your department, contact the Graduate Coordinator for the department offering the course. A full list of department contacts can be found on the Graduate School's [Degrees & Programs webpage](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/degrees-programs).

_Unable to register a student after the 12th class day?_
* Registration after the 12th class day is considered Late Registration and cannot be completed using the mainframe's Online Registration System. Instead, fill out the Graduate School's [Request for Late Registration Form](https://utexas.box.com/s/t7x1iu0dgr9xjy3qud65rtscxjdv3d6h) and obtain a petition from the student's Graduate Advisor explaining the reason for the late registration. Submit both the form and petition to [GradStudentSvcs@austin.utexas.edu](mailto:gradstudentsvcs@austin.utexas.edu).

_Unable to drop or change the grading basis of a class after the 12th class day?_
* Drops and grading basis changes after the 12th class day cannot be completed using the mainframe's Online Registration System. Instead, fill out the [Graduate Add/Drop Form](https://lbj.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/add_drop_form_fillable_2020_1.pdf), which must be signed by the student, course instructor(s), and student's Graduate Advisor. Submit the form to [GradStudentSvcs@austin.utexas.edu](mailto:gradstudentsvcs@austin.utexas.edu).
