# How to Register Students Using UT mainframe

Student registration is handled by UT Austin's Administrative Computer System, or *mainframe*. This guide will walk you step by step through the student registration process, allowing you to manage students class schedules, add and drop classes, change class grading bases, and more. 

## Access UT mainframe - Student Portal
1. Navigate to the [UT mainframe online](https://virtel.its.utexas.edu/w2h/appmenu.htm+applist).

2. Click on the option `Students COM-PLETE`, which will load the Student Portal within the UT mainframe.

3. Sign in with your UT EID and password.

5. Type the EID of the student you are attempting to register, then hit Enter.

8. Once you've typed in the action code and unique number, hit Enter. If added successfully, the course will appear below, and the student's class and hours should update.
