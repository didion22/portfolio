### Change a Class Grading Basis

> [!WARNING]
>
> [Graduate School Policy](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/navigating/policies/academic/grades) limits how many classes a student can take as Credit/No Credit.
> * **Master's students**: No more than 20% of the Master's Program of Work can be taken as Credit/No Credit.
> * **Doctoral students**: No more than "a comparable portion" of the doctoral Program of Work can be taken as Credit/No Credit. Check with the student's Graduate Advisor to determine a "comparable portion".
>   
> If you're unsure about the number of classes a student has taken as Credit/No Credit, you can view their full academic record in [EASI](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/easi/index.WBX).

1. Type `4` in the **ACTION CODE** field.

2. In the **UNIQUE** field, type the `5-digit unique number` for the class you are attempting to change.

3. Press the Enter key. In the student's class schedule below, a **Z** will appear next to the affected class, indicating that it is being taken as Credit/No Credit. The application will also display a text prompt confirming that the class has been changed to Credit/No Credit.

## Common Pitfalls
_Blocked from registering a student for a class outside your department?_
* The Online Registration System prevents administrators from registering students for classes offered outside of their department. To register a student for a class outside your department, contact the Graduate Coordinator for the department offering the class. A full list of department contacts can be found on the Graduate School's [Degrees & Programs webpage](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/degrees-programs).

_Unable to register a student after the 12th class day?_
* Registration after the 12th class day is considered "late" and cannot be completed using the Online Registration System. Instead, fill out the Graduate School's [Request for Late Registration Form](https://utexas.box.com/s/t7x1iu0dgr9xjy3qud65rtscxjdv3d6h) and obtain a petition from the student's Graduate Advisor explaining the reason for the late registration. Submit both the form and petition to [GradStudentSvcs@austin.utexas.edu](mailto:gradstudentsvcs@austin.utexas.edu).

_Unable to drop or change the grading basis of a class after the 12th class day?_
* Drops and grading basis changes after the 12th class day cannot be completed using the Online Registration System. Instead, fill out the [Graduate Add/Drop Form](https://lbj.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/add_drop_form_fillable_2020_1.pdf) and obtain the signatures of the student, class instructor(s), and the student's Graduate Advisor. Submit the completed form to [GradStudentSvcs@austin.utexas.edu](mailto:gradstudentsvcs@austin.utexas.edu).
