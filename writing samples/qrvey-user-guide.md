# How to Create a Chart using Qrvey's Chart Builder

Qrvey's Partner Platform allows you to quickly and easily visualize your data using the Chart Builder. This guide will walk you through the Chart Builder architecture, as well as how to create charts using Chart Builder.

## Chart Builder Overview 
explanation here....

## Create a New Chart
To create a bar chart, click the “Add Chart” button in the menu at the top of the Qrvey Partner Platform dashboard. This will open the Chart Builder window.

## Select the Data
Next, select the dataset you wish to visualize. Available datasets are listed in the Data panel to the left. You may also search for datasets using the search bar. 

## Populate the Chart

After selecting the dataset, you will now be able to choose which categories and values you wish to display with the chart. Drag the data column you want to display as a category into the Category field at the top of the Chart Builder window. Alternatively, you can also drag your desired data column directly onto the canvas. While hovering over the canvas, the canvas will change color in areas that can receive data columns. Once you have given the canvas a data column, it will automatically plot a resulting chart from the column.  

Drag the other data column you wish to display into the Value field at the top of the Chart Builder window, or directly onto the canvas.

Drag the other data column you wish to display into the Value field at the top of the Chart Builder window, or directly onto the canvas. 

The Chart Builder will aggregate your data columns and immediately visualize the data into a chart. The default chart type is a bar chart, but you can change this at any time in the Charts menu in the right-side panel. In most cases, the Chart Builder will maintain your selections when building the new chart type. 

The default aggregate setting is “sum”, but you can change this and other sorting, calculation, and formatting settings by clicking the 3 dots on the right side of the data column field near the top of the Chart Builder.

To remove a data column, you can drag the column out of the field at the top of the Chart Builder window. You can also change the data columns by dragging new data columns directly onto the canvas in areas that can receive data columns, or by replacing the columns in the field(s) at the top of the Chart Builder window. 

## Edit and Save
Now that you’ve created your chart, you can adjust and enhance the chart using the chart configuration panel to the right of the chart canvas.

You have the option to add a name and description for your chart in the fields at the top of the Chart Builder window. 

Once you are satisfied with your chart, click the “Save Chart” button in the upper right corner to save your chart. You may also click the X button in the upper right corner to discard your chart without saving. 

Once you’ve saved your chart, the chart will be added to your dashboard. To edit your chart after it’s been added to your dashboard, click the 3 dots on the right side of the chart and select “Edit”. This will reopen the Chart Builder and allow you to make changes. To save your changes, click the “Save Chart” button.
